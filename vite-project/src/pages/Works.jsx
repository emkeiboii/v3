                Working in a pair, we dedicated ourselves to creating a simple
                and intuitive website that can be easily navigated by users of
                all age groups. Our goal was to ensure a welcoming,
                user-friendly experience that reflects the warmth and
                inclusivity of Isola&apos;s environment. Every design choice was
                made ensuring that no one would feel overwhelmed or confused,
                regardless of their familiarity with technology.

              <p>
                We created a clean and elegant logo by merging the letters C and
                S to represent the initials of SealColor. SealColor is a sealing
                wax company that distributes both in Italy and internationally.
                The design is straightforward and memorable, reflecting the
                company&apos;s identity and focus.

                This is my personal logoâ€”simple, compact, and designed to be
                easily recognizable at any size. It reflects my approach to
                creating things, standing out from typical combined-letter logos
                with its simple and thoughtful design.
